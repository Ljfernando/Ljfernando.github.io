					<h1>About Me</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am currently in my third year as an undergrad at the University of San Francisco studying in the Data Science program. During my freetime, I enjoy singing, performing, cycling and messing around with data. In order to keep a data-driven lifestyle I am constantly playing around with Kaggle datasets and reading about various statistical learning algorithms. As an undergrad, I hope to gain the fundamentals in mathematical statistics and computer science and apply it to the world of data science. After graduating in May 2018 my goal is to continue education in a masters program in order to further enhance my data science knowledge.</p>

					<h2><a href = "https://ljfernando.github.io/PredictHousingPrices/">Regression Analysis of Ames, Iowa Housing</a></h2>
					<p>This project utilizes various supervised learning techniques to determine the sale price of a given house based on the property's attributes(i.e., number of rooms, square footage and neighborhood). The dataset was provided through Kaggle.com and includes 79 different variables for almost 3000 different houses sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006-2010. In the preprocessing phase I use Multivariate Imputation of Chained Equations to impute missing values. Regression techniques such as a basic linear regression model and generalized boosted trees are used to predict the sale price. All scripts are written in the R environment.</p>

					<h2><a href = "https://github.com/Ljfernando/MovieRecommendation/blob/master/README.md">Collaborative Filtering for Movie Recommendations</a></h2>
					<p>This Movie Recommendation program utilizes collaborative filtering to recommend movies the user may enjoy. Data used is original data from MovieLens and consists of over 100k ratings for over 1000 different movies. Similarity metrics used are Cosine similarity, Jaccard Index and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. All programming performed in Python.</p>

					<h2><a href = "https://ljfernando.github.io/BikeSharing/">Analysis of the SF Bike Share Program</a></h2>
					<p>In this project we performed statistical analyses on the San Francisco Bike Sharing program. After implementing data cleaning and incorporating outside features we created a model that predicts the amount of Bike Share rentals on a given day. Regression techniques include linear regression, single trees and other tree ensemble methods. We analyzed the importance of using cross validation in evaluating model accuracy and the justification of using more complex models. All scripting and analyses performed in the R environment.</p>
